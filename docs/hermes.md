# Hermes agent backend

Hermes is one of the **swappable agentic backends** the os-server can run behind
its agent gateway. The brain is pluggable (CLAUDE.md): os-server talks to
whatever backend `config.agent_runtime` selects through the single
`domain.AgentGateway` interface, so the rest of the pipeline (HAL TTS, `[HW:/…]`
hardware markers, Flow Monitor SSE, sensing drain, Telegram fan-out) never knows
which brain is active.

- **`openclaw`** (default): persistent WebSocket to the OpenClaw daemon. See `docs/os-server.md` + `internal/openclaw`.
- **`hermes`**: HTTP + SSE client against a local Hermes API server (OpenAI *Responses API* style). This doc. Code: `os/services/internal/hermes/`.

## 1. When and how it is selected

`agent_runtime` in `config.json` picks the backend; resolution lives in
`internal/agent/factory.go` `ProvideGateway()`:

| `agent_runtime` | Backend |
|---|---|
| unset | falls back to `gateway.default` in `devices/<type>/DEVICE.md`, then OpenClaw if that is empty too |
| `"openclaw"` | OpenClaw (default) |
| `"hermes"` | Hermes (`hermes.ProvideService`) |
| `"picoclaw"` | PicoClaw (`picoclaw.ProvideService`) — persistent WebSocket client; assumes the PicoClaw service is already running. See `docs/picoclaw.md` + `internal/picoclaw`. |
| anything else | OpenClaw (logged as `FALLBACK — unknown runtime=…`) |

When `agent_runtime` is unset in `config.json`, the backend is taken from the
device's declared `gateway.default` (`devices/<type>/DEVICE.md`); OpenClaw is used
only if that is also empty. The banner logs `source` so you can tell which won.

On startup `ProvideGateway` prints an `AGENT BACKEND ACTIVE → HERMES` banner with
`base_url`, `conversation`, `model`, and `api_key_set`. There is **no per-unit
config** for these yet — they are compile-time constants in
`internal/hermes/constants.go`:

| Const | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BaseURL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8642` | Local Hermes API server |
| `APIKey` | `hermes-api-key` | Bearer for Hermes |
| `Conversation` | `device-main` | Named channel all turns flow into |
| `Model` | `hermes-agent` | Model id sent to Hermes |

Hermes itself is assumed to be already running on the device at `BaseURL` with
all skills provisioned; os-server is only a per-request client.

## 2. What changes vs OpenClaw — and what does not

| | OpenClaw | Hermes |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | one persistent WebSocket | stateless HTTP POST + SSE per turn |
| Connection state | socket up/down | `/health` poller goroutine (`health.go`) drives `ready`/`connectedAt` |
| Session | the socket | server-side UUID via `X-Hermes-Session-Id` header (§3) |
| Downstream pipeline | — | **identical** — Hermes translates SSE → the same `domain.WSEvent` frames |

Because Hermes emits the same `domain.WSEvent` shape that the OpenClaw handler
(`server/agent/delivery/http/handler_events.go`) already consumes, HAL TTS,
`[HW:/…]` marker routing, monitor SSE, the sensing drain, and Telegram fan-out
all stay untouched. `*hermes.Service` satisfies `domain.AgentGateway` in full
(`Name()`="Hermes", `IsReady`, `ConnectedAt`, `AgentUptime`, `IsBusy`/`SetBusy`,
`QueuePendingEvent`, `SendChat*`, `StartWS`, …).

## 3. Session & conversation model

Hermes has no socket, so the "session" is server-side:

- Every response carries the `X-Hermes-Session-Id` response header — one UUID per
  conversation, stable across reconnects. `Service.sessionUUID` shadows it.
- `Conversation` (`device-main`) is the named channel every turn flows into; all
  chat/sensing/Telegram turns share it so the agent keeps one context.
- `Service.lastResponseID` caches the latest `response.id`, used to chain turns
  (Responses-API style continuation).

State is in-memory only (`sessionUUID`, `lastResponseID`, `reqCounter` + the
guard / broadcast / web_chat / pose-bucket run trackers); nothing persists across
an os-server restart.

## 4. Request protocol — `POST /v1/responses`

`client.go` POSTs a `streamRequest` with `stream: true` and reads an SSE stream:

```jsonc
{
  "model": "hermes-agent",
  "conversation": "device-main",
  "stream": true,
  "instructions": "…",        // optional system/role text
  "input": "<text>",           // plain turn …
  "title": "…"                 // optional
}
```

For **vision** turns `input` is a multi-part array instead of a string — Hermes
accepts both shapes:

```jsonc
"input": [{ "role": "user", "content": [
  { "type": "input_text",  "text": "…" },
  { "type": "input_image", "image_url": "data:…" }
]}]
```

## 5. SSE → `domain.WSEvent` translation

The SSE consumer (`client.go`) streams `response.*` events; `translator.go` maps
them into `domain.WSEvent` frames and dispatches them through the handler
registered by `StartWS` — the same path OpenClaw uses. The turn-lifecycle mirror
matches OpenClaw: `activeTurn` flips true on send and false on
`response.completed`; the completed result carries `response.id` (cached as
`lastResponseID`) and the full assistant text for send-and-wait callers.

Sensing/pose markers are stripped before send using the same regexes as OpenClaw
(`[snapshot: …]`, `[pose_bucket: …]`, `[pose_worst: …]`) so the agent never sees
internal hardware markers.

## 6. Connection state & health

No socket means liveness is polled. `health.go` runs a `/health` poller that
flips `ready` / `connectedAt`, derives `agentStartedAt` from
`/health/detailed.uptime_s` when available, and uses `hasConnected` to skip the
"reconnected" TTS chime on the first successful poll. `AgentUptime()` reports the
Hermes process uptime, independent of os-server.

## 7. Busy state & pending sensing events

Identical contract to OpenClaw: while a turn is active (`IsBusy`), passive sensing
events are dropped or buffered (`QueuePendingEvent`, last-write-wins per type) and
replayed when idle, so ambient signals never interrupt an in-flight command.

## 8. Telegram fan-out

`telegram.go` / `telegram_sender.go` route agent replies back to the originating
Telegram chat. `markTelegramOrigin(runID, chatID)` records where a turn came from
and `consumeTelegramOrigin(runID)` reads it back at reply time, so a Telegram-
initiated turn answers in the right chat while still flowing through the shared
pipeline.

## 9. Voice

`hal.go` wires Hermes turns into the HAL voice path (TTS on speak-end, the same
`lib/hal` entry points OpenClaw uses), so spoken interaction works the same
regardless of backend.

## 10. Operating it

Hermes is installed by `os/services/internal/hermes/install.sh` (co-located with
its implementation). The script is **embedded in os-server** (`go:embed`,
registered via `lib/runtimereg`), so it ships + OTA-updates with the binary;
os-server materializes it to `/usr/local/lib/os-runtimes/hermes/install.sh` and
switch-runtime runs that local copy — fully offline, no CDN round-trip. (The CDN
path `${RUNTIMES_BASE_URL}/hermes/install.sh` remains a fallback for backends not
compiled into the binary.) The installer pulls the Hermes CLI to
`/usr/local/bin/hermes` **stage by stage** (see below), stops `openclaw` (so the
skill import doesn't race its running state), seeds the `API_SERVER_*` keys in
`~/.hermes/.env`, then **delegates all `config.yaml` + skill setup to the presync
hook**, which it invokes inline, and finally installs + starts the gateway as a
**system service** via `hermes gateway install --system --run-as-user root` +
`hermes gateway start --system` (unit: **`hermes-gateway.service`**). Because the
presync hook does the config + skills (see below) and the installer runs it
inline, a direct `bash install.sh` is fully configured and running.

> **Staged CLI install (skips `node-deps`).** Rather than the monolithic
> `curl | bash --skip-setup`, the installer downloads the upstream installer
> (`https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/install.sh`) to a temp file and drives
> only these stages, in order:
> `prerequisites repository venv python-deps path config`
> (each via `bash <installer> --stage <name> --non-interactive`). It deliberately
> **skips the `node-deps` stage**: that stage runs an `npm install` of
> browser-tool native modules (node-gyp) that hangs indefinitely on the ARM board,
> and a voice device never uses browser tools — the gateway is Python-only and
> doesn't need them. After the loop it stamps
> `echo git > /usr/local/lib/hermes-agent/.install_method` so a later
> `hermes update` recognizes this as a git install.

> **Install log lives off zram.** The installer tees all stdout+stderr to
> `$HERMES_LOG`, default **`/root/.hermes/install.log`** (persistent rootfs) —
> **not** under `/var/log`, which on these boards is a volatile zram mount
> (log2ram) wiped on reboot, exactly losing the install log when you need it.
> Follow it live with `tail -f /root/.hermes/install.log`; override the path with
> `HERMES_LOG=…` in the environment before invoking.

> Unit name: the gateway runs as `hermes-gateway.service`. The installer declares
> this in `/usr/local/lib/os-runtimes/hermes/service` so `switch-runtime` enables
> the right unit (§11); `reset_hermes.go` targets the same unit.

### The presync hook owns `config.yaml` + skills

The Hermes model config in `config.yaml` and the OpenClaw-imported skills are owned
by the **presync hook** (`internal/hermes/presync.sh`), **not** by `install.sh`.
**os-server materializes the hook to `/usr/local/bin/runtime-hermes-presync` on
every switch** (`materializePresync`, registered via `runtimereg.RegisterPresync`),
so a plain os-server OTA refreshes it on disk — unlike a copy written once by
`install.sh`, which `switch-runtime` skips on a later switch (the *activation gap*;
see `docs/adding-agent-runtime.md` §3). The hook runs right before the gateway
starts (and inline during install) and does three things, in order:

1. **Restores skills** — when `~/.hermes/skills/openclaw-imports` is empty (first
   install OR after a factory reset wiped it), runs `hermes claw migrate` (it
   **copies** OpenClaw skills, no transform). Guarded on the dir being empty so a
   normal switch is a no-op (no re-import churn). `claw migrate` also touches
   SOUL/MEMORY, but harmlessly: the Go persona migration (§12) runs afterwards and
   rewrites those cleanly, so only the skills persist.
2. **Ensures the `config.yaml` model structure** (idempotent — self-heals after a
   factory reset's `hermes setup --reset` blanks it). It coerces a reset-left
   `model: ''` back to a map, then asserts:
   - `.model.provider = custom:autonomous`
   - `.model.default = "Auto-AI"` — the **fixed** campaign-api model alias. os-server
     sends a fixed request model (`constants.go` `Model`) per turn, so this is **not**
     taken from `llm_model` (that is OpenClaw's primary model, irrelevant to Hermes).
   - `.custom_providers[0]` → `name: autonomous`, `key_env: AUTONOMOUS_API_KEY`,
     `api_mode: anthropic_messages`, `base_url` (default campaign-api, overridden below).
3. **Syncs per-device values** from `config.json` (only non-empty fields, so
   unconfigured channels are untouched):

| `config.json` | → | Hermes |
|---|---|---|
| `llm_base_url` | → | `config.yaml` `.custom_providers[0].base_url` |
| `llm_api_key` | → | `.env` `AUTONOMOUS_API_KEY` |
| `telegram_bot_token` | → | `.env` `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` |
| `telegram_user_id` | → | `.env` `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` |
| `slack_bot_token` / `slack_app_token` / `slack_user_id` | → | `.env` `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` / `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` / `SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS` |
| `discord_bot_token` / `discord_guild_id` / `discord_user_id` | → | `.env` `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` / `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` / `DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS` |
| `whatsapp_user_id` | → | `.env` `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_USERS` |

`.env` `API_SERVER_KEY` must equal `constants.go` `APIKey` (`hermes-api-key`) or
every turn 401s. Hermes must listen on `127.0.0.1:8642` to match `BaseURL`.

To target a different Hermes endpoint / key / model today, edit
`internal/hermes/constants.go` and rebuild (making these per-unit configurable is
future work).

## 11. Switching backends at runtime

You do not edit `config.json` by hand. Three triggers — **MQTT** `hermes.setup` /
`picoclaw.setup` / `openclaw.setup` (the kind itself names the target backend — no
`runtime` field; each maps `hermes.setup → hermes`, `picoclaw.setup → picoclaw`,
`openclaw.setup → openclaw`, the last being the revert-to-baseline path), **HTTP**
`POST /api/device/agent-runtime` (`{"runtime":"hermes"}`), and the **web**
Settings → *Runtime* section — all funnel into one method,
`device.Service.UpdateAgentRuntime` (`internal/device/service.go`). It validates
the runtime, resolves the currently-active `old` runtime, then launches the
switcher in its own transient systemd unit **and blocks on its exit code**
(`systemd-run --wait`, so it learns whether the switch landed or rolled back):

```
switch-runtime <new> <old>
```

**`config.agent_runtime` is persisted only AFTER the switch lands, never before.**
`UpdateAgentRuntime` runs `switch-runtime` first and writes `config.agent_runtime
= <new>` (under the config lock) **only if it exits 0**. On failure `config.json`
stays at `<old>` — so a crash or reboot mid-switch resolves the still-installed old
backend instead of a half-installed new one, and there is nothing to revert
(neither memory nor disk was ever moved to `<new>`). `switch-runtime` itself never
reads or writes `config.json`; os-server owns it entirely.

Because `UpdateAgentRuntime` waits for the real result, the MQTT path can ack the
**actual** outcome: `hermes.setup` / `picoclaw.setup` reply `success` only after the
switch lands, or `failure` (with the rollback reason) if it doesn't — no optimistic
"success". On a confirmed switch the device acks success **first**, then restarts
os-server itself (`device.Service.RestartForAgentRuntime`) so `factory.go`
re-resolves the gateway. The restart is intentionally deferred until after the ack:
if `switch-runtime` restarted os-server itself (as it used to), it would kill the
goroutine before the ack went out.

`switch-runtime` is **generic and backend-agnostic** — it is embedded in os-server
(`internal/device/switch_runtime.sh` via `go:embed`) and written to
`/usr/local/bin/switch-runtime` on demand, so it is versioned and OTA-updated with
the binary and needs **no imager/setup.sh change ever**. For a target backend `X`
it:

1. resolves `X`'s unit name (default `X.service`, or whatever the installer
   declared in `/usr/local/lib/os-runtimes/X/service` — hermes →
   `hermes-gateway`) and checks whether `X` is **installed AND usable** — not just
   that the unit file exists. A backend counts as installed only when the unit is
   present **and** an optional installer-provided verify hook at
   `/usr/local/lib/os-runtimes/X/verify` passes (hermes drops one that runs
   `command -v hermes`); backends without a verify hook (e.g. openclaw, whose
   `openclaw.service` is baked by setup.sh) fall back to unit-presence alone. If it
   is not installed/usable, it runs `X`'s installer — the binary-embedded copy at
   `/usr/local/lib/os-runtimes/X/install.sh` first, else
   `curl ${RUNTIMES_BASE_URL}/X/install.sh | bash`. This closes the orphaned-unit
   trap: a stale `<X>.service` left behind with the backend's binary gone/broken
   used to read as "installed" and never reinstall;
2. runs the optional `/usr/local/bin/runtime-X-presync` hook (hermes's syncs
   `llm_*`, per §10);
3. `systemctl enable --now <X-unit>` **and asserts it actually reached active**
   (a unit can `enable --now` cleanly yet crash immediately, e.g. a missing
   binary). If it does **not** start and the installer hadn't already run this run,
   the unit looks orphaned from a prior half-install — switch-runtime
   **reinstalls once and retries** (re-running the presync hook) before giving up;
   this self-heals even backends without a verify hook. Once `<X>` is confirmed
   active it stops the old unit with up to 3 `disable --now <old-unit>` retries
   (verifying it went inactive between tries); after 3 attempts it proceeds
   regardless so a stuck old runtime never blocks the switch;
4. exits `0`. It does **not** restart os-server (it used to) — os-server, which is
   blocked on `--wait`, acks the outcome and then restarts itself. On any failure
   before the switch is confirmed, its rollback trap restarts the **old** systemd
   unit only and exits non-zero. It does **not** touch `config.json` — os-server
   owns `config.agent_runtime` and never persisted `<new>` (it persists only on a
   clean exit 0), so on failure config is already `<old>` on disk and there is
   nothing to revert.

Confirm the swap from the new `AGENT BACKEND ACTIVE → …` banner + a healthy
`/health` poll in the logs.

**Adding a new backend** (claudecode, …) is just an `install.sh` next
to that backend's implementation (`internal/<name>/install.sh`), `go:embed`-ed +
registered in `lib/runtimereg` from the package's `init()` (it must create
`<name>.service`, optionally drop `runtime-<name>-presync`), plus a
`domain.AgentRuntimes` entry for validation + the web dropdown. A backend already
needs a gateway client under `internal/<name>` and a `factory.go` case, so the
embedded installer adds no new coupling — and nothing in the imager, switcher, or
CDN has to change.
